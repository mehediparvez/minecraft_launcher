# Setup Window Improvements - User Control

## Changes Made

### 1. Window Close Handling
- **Before**: Setup window couldn't be closed, forcing users to complete setup
- **After**: Users can close the window with a confirmation dialog offering options:
  - **Quit Application**: Completely exit Void Client
  - **Continue Setup**: Stay in setup process  
  - **Cancel**: Keep setup window open

### 2. New Setup Options
Added three buttons to the setup window:
- **Start Download**: Begin the setup process (original functionality)
- **Skip Setup**: Skip setup with warning about potential issues
- **Cancel**: Close the setup window

### 3. Skip Setup Functionality
- Shows confirmation dialog explaining what components will be missing
- Warns that Void Client may not work properly without components
- Allows users to proceed anyway if they choose
- Can re-run setup later from menu

### 4. Menu Integration
Added "Run Setup" option to the File menu:
- Accessible after skipping setup
- Allows users to run setup at any time
- Resets setup completion status

### 5. Window Behavior
- Removed `minimizable: false` and `maximizable: false` restrictions
- Users can now minimize the setup window if needed
- Close button (X) works with confirmation dialog

## User Experience Flow

### Option 1: Complete Setup (Recommended)
1. Setup window appears
2. User clicks "Start Download"
3. Components download with progress
4. Setup completes, window closes automatically

### Option 2: Skip Setup
1. Setup window appears
2. User clicks "Skip Setup"
3. Confirmation dialog warns about missing components
4. If confirmed, setup is skipped and main app starts
5. User can run setup later from File menu

### Option 3: Quit Application
1. Setup window appears
2. User clicks "Cancel" or window close (X)
3. Confirmation dialog offers options
4. User can choose to quit entirely

## Benefits

✅ **User Choice**: No longer forced to complete setup  
✅ **Better UX**: Clear options and confirmations  
✅ **Accessibility**: Can run setup later if needed  
✅ **Transparency**: Clear warnings about skipping setup  
✅ **Flexibility**: Multiple ways to handle the setup process  

## Code Changes

### Files Modified:
1. **setup-manager.js**: Enhanced close handling, added skip functionality
2. **setup.html**: Added skip button and confirmation logic  
3. **index.js**: Added "Run Setup" menu option

### New IPC Handlers:
- `setup:skip`: Handles skipping setup process
- Enhanced `close` event handling with confirmation dialog

This provides a much better user experience while still encouraging users to complete the setup process for optimal functionality.
